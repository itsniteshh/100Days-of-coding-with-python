# 100 Days Of Code - Log
**** Note: Any day that specifies "Day xx.5" refers to a day that was mainly full of research, and not so much coding. Since this challenge is to code for one hour a day, I would feel like I was cheating if I was to use those days as actually part of the challenge, even though there was still plenty of learning happening. Regardless, those days and related notes are still present in this log as a reminder of what all was learned and to show that progress was still being made, rather than there just being gaps in the log. ****

### Day 46: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed Problem Set 3 of the [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

**Thoughts**
* This Problem Set was a ton of fun. It was creating a hangman game, which ultimately was pretty easy. However, it became far more difficult once we were challenged to rewrite all of the functions as one liners, some of them in more than one way. It was definitely hard because they hinted at what functions they wanted you to use, only we had never used or even heard of those before. The challenge then transformed into researching what the functions were, how to use them, then combining those with other aspects learned throughout the course to generate the one line versions. I definitely scratched my head more than a few times, but once I realized exactly what was going on, it was pretty straightforward.

### Day 45: June 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed Lecture 6 of the [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

**Thoughts**
* As with Lecture 5, Lecture 6 went more in depth with Dictionaries than I have been before. We also went back and made previous exercises more efficient by utilizing dictionaries (e.g., calculating the Fibonnaci value of a number). It is amazing the difference in operations, and consequently speed, between the two programs.

### Day 44: June 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed Lecture 5 of the [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

**Thoughts**
* Lecture 5 had a lot of good information in, especially when it comes to mutability. That is one thing that had been mentioned in passing in some other course I took, but it was only to say something along the lines of "Immutable objects cannot be changed, whereas mutable objects can." Well, that is fairly bland, but at the time, I did not think there was really any more to it than that. Boy was I wrong. I mean, yes, that is ultimately what it means, but what that does not detail is just how important that can be. The biggest part of this is how the objects are stored/referenced in memory, especially when setting variables based on other variables, and knowing that how they each behave is completely eye-opening.

### Day 43: June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed Problem Set 2 of the [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

**Thoughts**
* Admittedly, I had a decent amount of trouble working through the last problem of this set. In the end, it was mainly my brain just trying to overcomplicate the entire problem, but it did make for a good lesson in just walking away, taking a small break, then coming back to reevaluate the problem. After doing so, I realized I could have made my code a more efficient in the previous problems, from which this code was built upon, by solving the problems a different way. By reworking the previous problems' code, I was no longer trying to make inefficient code work, which allowed me to more easily picture the solution for the final problem.

### Day 42: June 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed Lecture 4 of the [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

**Thoughts**
* As mentioned before, this course is definitely taking what I learned to the next level, and I love it. I do believe that learning the basics of the language prior to taking the class has helped immensely, as it is certainly much faster paced than Codecademy was. What is great is that I am now just barely ahead in my learning on Codecademy than where I am on MIT, so it the concepts are still fresh in my mind, and I can just build on it with the MIT course. For example, we just finished learning about recursion in the MIT course, and I was able to push my ability to think in that manner with its more challenging exercises.

### Day 41: June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the Recursion Code Challenges and stared the Asymptotic Notation lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* As expected, the Recursion Code Challenges were not much different than the actual exercises, but that is okay. It was more practice, and the more you practice, the more familiar you will be with it.
* Asymptotic Notation is something that will ve pretty useful in the actual designing of programs, and it is something that I have never really taken into consideration with other programming I have done, including robotics. I have always had programs that ran fast enough to where there was no noticeable lag in them, so it was never something I really thought about. The only limitation I have ever really come up against was creating code that would fit onto a certain chip, so efficient code was still necessary, but it was a different kind of efficiency: size, not operations.

### Day 40: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the final set of Recursion exercises and quizzes in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* Recursion is starting to grow on me, even though I still only see a limited use for it. I am hoping the upcoming Code Challenge for Recursion will actually be a challenge (the previous challenges were not much more difficult than the actual lessons).

### Day 39: June 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the first set of Recursion exercises and quizzes in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* I am still on the fence about Recursion, but after reading more about it on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/), I am starting to see how it could be useful in specific situations. It still seems to have a limited use, but it is good to know for those times where it can prove beneficial.

### Day 38: June 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Started Lecture 4 of the [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

**Thoughts**
* I am thoroughly enjoying this class so far. Sure, it is basically going over the same fundamentals of Python that I learned elsewhere, however the focus is not actually the coding itself. The focus is on the actual concepts behind what you are trying to write code for. Instead of "Let's go code XYZ, while I give a general overview of what you are doing means", the class is saying "Here is the problem we want to solve, here are some conceptual ways we could go about it, here is a way we can code this using Python, but what does it actually mean? What could we do differently to change the outcome? Why would that work?" It is definitely hitting all the Computer Science points that I was hoping it would, and since it is MIT, I would expect no less.

  Now, this isn't to say that how I learned the language initially was bad. The platform I used/still use (Codecademy) utilizes a very hands on approach to learning a language. However, it definitely holds your hand through the entire process, and although that can be helpful at times, I feel like it does more harm than good. The first time I learned Python a few years ago, I hardly retained anything at all. Once the course was done, I still couldn't code anything because I didn't really understand how to go about doing it. Sure, I could tell you what the actual syntax was, but that doesn't help much if you are having issues creating it from scratch. In fact, even going through the new Python 3 course years later, I still had issues retaining the information because it is very much a "Step 1: Do this. Step 2: Do this." process, and it leaves all the problem solving at the door. But that is where we learn the most. Being challenged and getting things wrong the first time, trying to figure out why it was wrong, then fixing those issues is the best way to learn. With the MIT course, it is very much about learning the core concepts of how and why everything works before code even gets involved. This is highly beneficial to me. Maybe it is because I already know the language well enough to do the basics without looking anything up, but even with that being the case, learning the how and why is what will allow me to take ideas from my head and put them into code.

### Day 37: June 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed Lecture 3 of the [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

**Thoughts**
* Now we are starting to get deeper into concepts like algorithms and the math behind floats. This is what I have been looking forward to, and I am glad it is happening early on in the course. I am super excited to see how deep this rabbit hole goes.

### Day 36.5: June 4-10, 2021

I decided to lump all these days into one half day entry, as there was not any actual coding happening. Instead, I was going through a new Python book that I had ordered from Real Python. This was actually quite beneficial, as the book went deeper into topics than my lessons had. I only barely scratched the surface of the book, but I know it will definitely be a good reference if I have any questions about how something works.

### Day 36: June 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed Lecture 2 and Problem Set 1 of the [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

**Thoughts**
* Although the class is teaching parts of Python that I already know, the actual Computer Science behind the coding is being explained in much greater detail in this course. The textbook recommended for this course is a great resource for all kinds of Computer Science goodness. All that is left for Unit 1 is to complete the unit's Problem Set, which accounts for 40% of my grade.

### Day 35: June 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Started [MIT Course 6.00.1x](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/), completing all of Lecture 1's assignments.
* Started the Recursion lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* As if I was not already challenging myself enough, I have officially started MIT course 6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. One bonus is that everything I have learned so far is pretty much going to be reiterated throughout this course, so it will be nice to have concepts that I already know in the class, while at the same time pushing beyond the limits of Codecademy's education. This is MIT, afterall, and it has already proven that it is going to make me think well outside the box. Its emphasis on Computer Science is really what is going to push my coding to the next level, and I cannot wait.
* Even though I spent today in the class, I still felt the need to progress at least a little in my Computer Science studies at Codecademy. Continuing on, I started learning about Recursion. This is another topic that I am very unclear on in regards to how it is actually going to be useful in the real world. Computationally, it is slower than iterating through a list because of its additional overhead, and I currently see no benefit of why I would not just use a list. There is clearly a missing piece to this puzzle, otherwise why would I be learning about recursion, linked lists, etc. if they were truly not any better than just using a list? I assume that is the downside to platforms like Codecademy who are simply teaching concepts, but only dive so deep. Luckily, I have the MIT course to take what I am learning at Codecademy to the next level.

### Day 34: June 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the Hash Maps lessons and project in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* Learning about and coding Hash Maps is the first time in this series of lists where I actually feel like I could benefit from using it in comparison to just a normal list, dictionary, etc. I cannot think of a good example of how I would utilize it off the top of my head, but hashing in general is a concept I am very familiar with because of my IT background, and utilizing that for indexing a database to find items quicker than iterating than huge lists just makes sense to me. We shall see how much deeper we go with these during the course, or if we are moving on altogether, but I would like to keep using these to get more comfortable with coding them.

### Day 33: May 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Continued the Hash Maps lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* Today involved a lot of conceptual learning about Hash Maps and the different methods of creating them. On the coding side, I was only able to complete the creation of the HashMap class today, but with the conceptual part out of the way, tomorrow's learning should be mostly about coding.

### Day 32: May 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the Stacks project and started the Hash Maps lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* Completing the rest of the Stacks project (Towers od Hanoi game) really made me think about my Python Terminal Game (Connect Four) and how I could have coded it differently to utilize OOP. I may end up going back and rewriting it using OOP, but if I do that, then I will also want to introduce the AI to the mix. This sounds like a good use for a Dev branch of the repo. This will have to be done in free time, though, so it may be a while before I get to it, as I start my MIT Introduction to Computer Science class on Wednesday.

**Today's Progress**
* Started the Stacks lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* Today I learned about Stacks, which are pretty straightforward. I still do not see the benefit over just using a normal list (see notes from yesterday), but I am having no issues working with them so far. I am currently about halfway done completing the Towers of Hanoi project.

### Day 30: May 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Finished the Queues lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* Queues are definitely a good example of using a single linked list, however I am still failing to see the benefit of all the extra work required to create, link, and remove nodes when you can easily make a queue with a standard list, add to the queue with the built-in append function, you don't have to link anything because lists are automatically indexed, and removal of the first item in the list can be done with the built-in pop or del functions. You also don't have to create methods for specific things like checking the size of the queue because you already have the built-in len function you can use on the list or peeking at the first item because you can just get the value of the first index by calling it. There must be some reason why linked lists are valuable, however, since there is a lot of focus on them in this course. I am sure the reason is I am not seeing it is because these queues are very basic to teach them, so perhaps I just need to go search for a more complicated queue to see the real benefit of them.

### Day 29: May 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Finished the Double Linked Lists lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).
* Cleaned up the CS101 Final Project.

**Thoughts**
* After finishing the lessons for Double Linked Lists, I can see a few real world use cases for them. In looking at the syllabus, I am very curious to see how all of this gets integrated into the upcoming lessons.
* I received some feedback on my terminal game in regards to PEP 8, so I went through and started cleaning the code up. This was mainly in regards to lines between functions and the spaces in my new_grid function, but also some tiny ones like using "is not None" vs using an equality operator like "!= None". I had no idea the latter was not really the correct way of doing that, even though the code worked just fine. I also decided to change some of the variables inside of the functions that shadowed global variables, even though you could still follow the code in the functions with ease. In doing all of this, I discovered linting using PyLint, and that was very nice to stumble upon. When playing with that, I also realized that these colored blocks that appear next to my code were actually clickable! That was a very handy thing to learn, and I will absolutely be making use of those in the future. Between all these little changes I have been making over the past week, I can comfortably say that code is now looking really nice. There are still some changes that could be made, but those changes would completely change the main structure and resulting in rewriting a lot of the program. It is probably best to just leave it as is, then introduce those types of changes on the next project.

### Day 28: May 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Started the Double Linked Lists lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* Okay, now we are getting somewhere with these types of lists. A regular Linked List did not make very much sense to me from a practicality standpoint, as with my current knowledge, I cannot foresee any use for such a list over just a normal list. Double Linked Lists, however, seem very useful to me. I was only able to complete about two-thirds of the lessons today, but I did enjoy these much more than just a single linked list. Being able to easily navigate both forwards and backwards in the list is a huge plus. Sure, there is a little more overhead in terms of reconstructing the node links when adding/removing a node, but that overhead is all done in the methods themselves, greatly outweighing any of the tediousness of navigating through a regular Linked List.

### Day 27: May 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Reworked the CS101 Final Project.
* Finished the Linked Lists lessons in CS102 of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* What I love so much about programming is constant learning of new ways to implement ideas. In this instance, I am talking about the use of f-strings. Now, I already learned that you could use an f-string to use variables directly in your strings, however I did not know you could do even more than that! My friend looked over the code said I should implement f-strings, and I was like "I already did where I could!". Enter the learning. Wow, I did not know you could use it to input practically anything! This is a total game changer. Between that and cleaning up some of the more repetitive things in the script, I can comfortably say that this game's script is looking pretty good now! I know I need to do something about the repetitiveness in the diagonal win checks, but I will have to spend some time thinking about how to do that, since it involves changes in the operators.
* Although I am still in the same boat as I was yesterday about linked lists (not exactly sure how these are helpful yet, in comparison to just normal lists), I did learn a bit about how to manipulate the lists to get some basic info out of them. I know there is still a lot to learn about these, so I am sure I will figure out the benefits of them soon enough. For now, I will just keep on trucking and soaking up all the information I can, so I will be fully ready once I do understand the benefits of using them.

**Today's Progress**
* Started the CS102 course of the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* I am very excited to be starting the CS102 course, as this course is all about Data Structures and Algorithms. This will certainly push my data handling, as well as programming, abilities to the next level. Today was learning about and coding Nodes and Linked Lists. I am still not exactly sure how this is necessarily helpful compared to a normal list, but I am sure I will find out soon enough.

### Day 25: May 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Finished the CS101 Final Project for the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

**Thoughts**
* It is complete! Creating the win check for the diagonals was definitely the most complicated part of this game, and although it took me a minute to figure out how to do it efficiently, it is working flawlessly now. I also added in error handling for the inputs because if an integer was not entered, it would simply exit the program. Now it is set to reprompt, and if an integer is not entered again, that player forfeits the game, and the other player wins! This was definitely a fun little project.
* Being mainly a solo gamer, I was wondering if I could create an AI opponent for the game. In order to have the AI actually be intelligent, instead of just randomly placing pieces, it would take a fair amount of work that is beyond the scope of the actual project. This is something I will likely come back to implement, though, as it would be a nice challenge for sure.

**Today's Progress**
* Continued working on the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) CS101 Final Project.

**Thoughts**
* Another successful day working on the project. I was able to complete the second win check, which is if there are four in a row in a column. I then started working on the win check for diagonals, which is a bit more complicated. While doing so, though, I realized I had no check in place for if the grid was completely full, meaning no more pieces could be placed resulting in a tie. I put this check in place, albeit not after spending way too much trying to figure out what was going wrong with it. Lo and behold, I made the silly mistake of looping through the list and not the range length of the list. After I figured that out, everything was working perfectly. Now all that is left is to finish the diagonal win check!

* Continued working on the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) CS101 Final Project.

**Thoughts**
* Today was a good day full of problem solving to figure out the best solution for a problem. While working on the check_win function, I went through a few different versions of the first piece, and the latest one now works perfectly. This includes a new function that is used inside of it, as well, and that piece will be used in the rest of the check_win function that has yet to be written. Now that I have the main system down for how I want this function to operate, I should hopefully be able to complete the final two parts of the check tomorrow.

### Day 22: May 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Continued working on the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) CS101 Final Project.

**Thoughts**
* To start the day off, I actually got to go through the process of reviewing and merging a pull request, which I have not had a chance to do before now, so that was a good process to learn. My biggest success of today was finally getting that choice validation to work correctly. After really thinking about it and talking about it out loud to a friend, I ended up figuring out exactly what I needed to before they even had a chance to reply. It was such a great epiphany! In the process of doing that, I was able to clean up a lot of the code, so now it is a lot easier to follow. All that is left to do now is create the check_win function and figure out one final nit-picky thing that is bugging me (if you enter a value that is not a digit, the program throws an error and exits).

### Status Update

This past week was a bit of a roller coaster. I had some medical issues arise, and my body did not respond well to the treatment at all. Both my physical and mental states were so out of balance, that I was unable to do hardly anything at all. Thankfully, my body is now starting to stabilize, which means I am able to actually think again and get back to programming! I can't wait to wrap up the CS101 Final Project.

Happy Coding, Everyone!

### Day 21: May 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Continued working on the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) CS101 Final Project.

**Thoughts**
* If there was ever a chasing your tail in programming, I think today was that day. What started out as being on the right path and making good progress ended in complete confusion as to why the program is behaving the way it is. I started by completing the choice validation to ensure there was no way that you could enter an incorrect value, and if you did, it would prompt as to what it was and ask you to enter a new value. This all worked flawlessly when testing it with hard set grid values, so it was time to implement the code that would find the next open row for the column selected, then place the piece according to the current player's number. This would work great unless a 0 was selected (valid options are 1-7) or a column was full. If 0 was selected, it would prompt accordingly, but no matter what column you chose next, it would always place your piece in the last column. This to me means that the column value is being set to -1, but I cannot tell where or why it is happening as of yet. If the column was full and you chose a column that was not full, it would give a TypeError saying it must be an integer or slice, not a NoneType, and exit the program. This really has confused me, as I am unsure where the value is being converted from an integer to None. Looks like tomorrow is going to be full of bug hunting!

### Day 20.5: May 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Continued working on the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) CS101 Final Project.

**Thoughts**
* Today I definitely went down a rabbit hole of tangents while working on the project, and I had a blast doing so. Although I did not get a ton of coding done on the project today, thus why I considered this to be a half day, I did learn some cool new tricks that I should be able to apply to the project when I resume working on it again tomorrow.

### Day 20: May 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Started working on the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) CS101 Final Project.

**Thoughts**
* For the Python Terminal Game final project, I decided to create a terminal version of Connect Four. The main reason behind this is because I wanted to choose something that would not take weeks to program, so I could move on to the new content sooner, but would still provide a little challenge. Turns out this little game is not quite as easy as I was thinking it was going to be, which is actually quite nice. It is not terribly difficult by any means, but I am finding that the more I code it, the more checks and error handling I will need to put in place in order for it to operate smoothly. Overall, though, it has been a lot of fun trial and error thus far. I am hoping to finish it by tomorrow, now that I have the main framework in place.

### Day 19: May 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Started working on the [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) on Codecademy.

**Thoughts**
* Seeing as I have already completed the Learn the Command Line, Learn Git, and Learn Python3 courses, the vast majority of the CS101 part of the career path has already been completed. This left me with only a few additional items to go through, with one of them being a project utilizing all three of those courses. The only portion left of CS101 is the final project, an off-platform portfolio project called Python Terminal Game, which I will begin working on tomorrow.

### Status Update

As you have noticed, it has been some time since my last commit, however it was not from a simple abandonment of the challenge from being too busy, not wanting to continue, etc. Instead, the past few weeks have been pretty rough with the sudden passing of my father-in-law, and as a result, this challenge took a backseat for obvious reasons. That being said, I feel like it is time to get my head back in the game and continue on with this challenge.

Reviewing where I left off, I believe I need to take a step back and look at different paths. Although the cybersecurity stuff was what I really wanted to get into, there is a lot of cybersecurity related items that are not coding related, and I do not want to start down that path in the middle of this challenge. Perhaps I will start a separate 100 Days challenge for myself later that is strictly cybersecurity related. With that in mind, there is still a lot that I have to learn about everyday Python programming, which will also make working on those cybersecurity tasks easier. There are also more relevant tasks I want to learn that would be more beneficial in the more immediate future (prospective jobs), so I want to start pursuing those instead. What exactly this will be is something I am going to work on figuring out today, then start working on that path tomorrow.

Happy Coding, Everyone!

### Day 18: April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Continued working on the [Port Scanner](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/port-scanner) project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**
* Today was particularly challenging. I noticed that none of the calls in main.py actually had errors, so it was not testing the error handling. I decided to make both a domain and IP invalid to test, and for some reason, my error handling was only taking one path instead of actually changing depending on whether it is a domain or IP. I ended up finding that this is because it kept returning a socket.gaierror for both cases, and there seemed to be no good way to differentiate between the domain and IP. I tried a whole slew of different ways to check to see if the domain or IP was valid, using pretty much every solution I could find online, but they still kept returning the same socket.gaierror. After messing with this for about five hours, I finally found solution to what I thought was going to be a simple solution of differentiating between a domain and IP. Let me just say that this simple problem has a very simple solution, and I would probably feel ashamed if I was actually seasoned in non-embedded Python, but it literally came down to a single line of code that split the target (variable holding either the domain or IP) with a period, then evaluated if the last item in the list was a digit or not with the isdigit method. Not knowing about this, I clearly had no idea that was an option, but holy moly is this is lifesaver in this application! I immediately put it to use, tested it, and my error handling now worked flawlessly.

**Today's Progress**
* Continued working on the [Port Scanner](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/port-scanner) project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**
* I was able to get the majority of the port scanner completed tonight, which required me researching how to do certain things in Python like validating a URL or IP. Although this scanner should have been completed tonight, my brain kept running in circles when it came to what should be a simple task of creating the formatted verbose text. Since I was just spinning my wheels, I decided it would be best to get some shuteye, give my brain a break, and pick it back up in the morning with a fresh perspective.

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the remaining lessons of [Python for Penetration Testing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security#python-for-penetration-testing) on freeCodeCamp.
* Started working on the [Port Scanner](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/port-scanner) project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**
* After going through all of the pentesting lessons, two things are pretty clear. One, it takes very little code to perform tasks that I thought would be incredibly more involved. Two, there is a ton I still need to learn about the sockets module, and I will need to study that in depth at some point after this challenge is complete. Otherwise, I will be stuck studying for a few days, maybe weeks, instead of actually coding.

### Day 15: April 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Finished the last of the [Inheritance and Composition: A Python OOP Guide](https://realpython.com/courses/inheritance-composition-python/) course on Real Python.

**Thoughts**
* I learned a lot from this course, as it covered a lot of material that was never even touched on Codecademy while initially learning Python. This course will definitely be one that I revisit once I start building programs from scratch to refresh on the lessons learned, as there is a lot of good info here.

### Day 14: April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Finished the majority of the [Inheritance and Composition: A Python OOP Guide](https://realpython.com/courses/inheritance-composition-python/) course on Real Python.

**Thoughts**
* Today was better symptom-wise, however I thought it would be best to continue with the video course, as there was a lot of good information there yesterday. Although I did not finish all of the videos today (there are nearly three hours worth for this course), I may finish them a little later tonight, so that I can focus solely on getting some coding done on the pentesting course from freeCodeCamp.

### Day 13.5: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the [Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python](https://realpython.com/courses/intro-object-oriented-programming-oop-python/) course on Real Python.
* Completed the [Supercharge Your Classes With Python super()](https://realpython.com/courses/python-super/) course on Real Python.
* Started the [Inheritance and Composition: A Python OOP Guide](https://realpython.com/courses/inheritance-composition-python/) course on Real Python.

**Thoughts**
* Today was day two after getting my first COVID vaccine shot, and I ended up with a pretty bad headache that put me down for the count. Even though I know I would not be able to focus on writing code, I still made sure to at least do something related. I ended up back on Real Python to go over a few more tutorials to reinforce what I had previously learned at Codecademy.

### Day 13: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the Nmap Scanner lessons of [Python for Penetration Testing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security#python-for-penetration-testing) on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**
* Seeing as there is a ton I still need to learn about sockets, I decided it was best to go back to the my freeCodeCamp projects. Today was developing a Nmap scanner, which of course had its fair share of hiccups. Although the video lesson made it seem like you just needed a single command (pip3 install python-nmap) to install the proper package, it ended up being a bit more than that. I kept getting error saying that nmap was not installed, and I could easily verify this because VS Code was not populating any of its modules. After a bit of research, I learned that Nmap itself also had to be installed (pip3 install nmap), as python-nmap referenced the module. Unfortunately, that was still throwing errors, and it took a random forum post to figure out why. Apparently, you have to install python-nmap as the user (pip3 install --user python-nmap). This finally allowed me to use the nmap module, but when running the script, it couldn't find what it needed in PATH. After reviewing the contents of PATH, the directory was indeed not there. I added directory location, but it was still giving the same error. It was only after I downloaded and installed Nmap directly from the website that it fully installed and populated PATH, then I had to reinstall python-nmap and restart the VS Code. Running the script was finally a success!
* Like the last time I went through a lesson, there was a lot of information left to be discovered on your own, as we never really got to understand the underlying modules we were using. Because of this, I have more research to do, so I can actually understand exactly what is going on when looking at the script, rather than having to rely on the person in the video to tell me what the code is doing. Only then will I truly be proficient at it.

### Day 12: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Continued learning more about sockets in Python.

**Thoughts**
* Today I was learning about how to handle multiple connections, and although I did learn more, it only brought about even more questions because now I want to know everything there is to know about this new module used. This is why I have insomnia. I get so carried away with looking up this, which tangents to that and that and that and that, which splits off to all of those, and so forth. Time to real it back in to focus on sockets.

* [My Socket Programming Repo](https://github.com/StingzLD/Socket_Programming)

### Day 11: April 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Started learning more about sockets before continuing on with the pentesting course.

**Thoughts**
* After a very rough few days for personal reasons, I was very happy to get back to coding, only to run into issues when trying to run the Python scripts in the VS Code terminal. Depending on the type of terminal, it would either just open the code in a VS Code tab (or go into the tab if it was already open) or give me a 'Permission Denied' error. After spending way too much time looking for a solution, I just decided to reinstall Git, as that seemed to be the biggest issue (the one providing the permission error). After reinstalling Git and relaunching VS Code, I was able to run the scripts without issue. I am thinking the Windows Updates caused an issue with it, but I will never know for sure. Either way, I was finally able to test my two new scripts side-by-side in VS Code successfully.

### Day 10: April 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the first three parts of [Python for Penetration Testing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security#python-for-penetration-testing) on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**
* I really wish this would have been a little more in depth with the intro, as the videos dive you right on in, as if you already know what the functions and methods do. The video roughly explains the pieces we are using, but only at a very high level. There will definitely be more studying required to fully understand the socket library.

### Day 9: March 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed [Information Security with HelmetJS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/) on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**
* Admittedly, this took me a bit to initially figure out, as I had to look up JS syntax on top of HelmetJS and BCrypt because I have not learned any of those yet. Nonetheless, I was able to successfully complete the challenges, which ended up being fairly easy once working with basic JS was no longer an issue. That being said, I am sure I will probably have to go back and look at the HelmetJS and BCrypt documentation in the future to refresh on how to configure and use the packages, but it is fairly straightforward once you have the information in front of you.

### Day 8: March 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the remaining [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Code Challenges: Dictionaries, Dictionaries (Advanced), Classes, Classes (Advanced).

**Thoughts**
* The remaining challenges were pretty low in difficulty, like the others, with the exception of Classes (Advanced). The only reason I say this, however, is because Codecademy had flaws in their instructions, so I had to figure out what exactly the tests were looking for then figure out how to change the code to reflect that. In that regard, it made it slightly more challenging, but it was also good practice in debugging using a test result.
* I also had my first big issue with Git today. I work on multiple machines, and I have the repos cloned on all of them. Tonight, I made a commit without first pulling, which then showed the commit message as merging. Considering this is not what I wanted, I wanted to undo the commit. I found that to do this you have to do a "git reset --hard HEAD~1", which I did, but it did not undo the merge it created when I pulled everything down. I decided to run it again to get rid of that, as that was the only commit still showing up for today, and although it got rid of that merge, it actually got rid of the previous commit as well! Luckily, I backed up my files before doing anything, so I just put those back in and made a new commit, but now my commit history is missing a commit, which makes it look like I did nothing that day. Ugh... Lesson learned. BE CAUTIOUS WHEN DOING A HARD RESET!!!

**Today's Progress**

**Thoughts**
* Due to some personal reasons, I was not in a mindset that would allow me to really focus on coding today. However, I did at least spend some time watching related videos.

### Day 6: March 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the following [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Code Challenges: Loops, Loops (Advanced), Functions, and Functions (Advanced).

**Thoughts**
* Although most of the challenges were of the same difficulty (or lack thereof) as yesterday, there was one in the Loops (Advanced) that actually caused me to think about how I would go about doing it, as I had to recall the ways a certain function behaved that I have not used for a little while. Overall, though, it was good practice to refresh my brain on lessons learned earlier in the course that were not used much in later lessons.

### Day 5: March 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the following [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Code Challenges: Control Flow, Control Flow (Advanced), Lists, Lists (Advanced).

**Thoughts**
* After completing the course yesterday, I noticed that there were two new sections in the course: Python Code Challenges and Python Code Challenges II. Naturally, I decided to take these on! After all, who am I to turn down a challenge. I mean, that is exactly how I ended up doing the 100DaysOfCode challenge in the first place! Sadly, though, the challenges were not very challenging so far, even the "advanced" ones.  Granted, there is only so complicated control flow and manipulating lists can get within the context of the course, but they still seemed a bit too easy. Up next are challenges for loops and functions, so hopefully those be more of a brain teaser.

### Day 4: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Finished the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy lesson.
* Completed the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy project.
* Completed the [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Codecademy class!!!

**Thoughts**
* The rest of the Function Arguments' lessons taught some very good ways to process code, as well as minimize the amount of code needing to be written.
* I am SO HAPPY that I have now completed the Learn Python 3 course from Codecademy!!! The question is, where do I want to go from here? I need to get work done on my CMMC Assessment Tool conversion side project, but there are also a couple of courses on freeCodeCamp that I want to pursue, specifically [Information Security](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/) and [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/). My current job is IT security, and I have been really wanting to get into using Python for scripting changes to the infrastructure, so that seems like the logical next step. What better way to build Python knowledge than while building tools to help with my job. On the flipside, I really want to start exploring data analysis with NumPy, Pandas, etc. Ultimately, I think both courses are going to be highly beneficial, as parsing through data collected in CSVs from multiple programs and making sense of it all is also a big part of my job.

### Day 3: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Worked through most of the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy lesson.

**Thoughts**
* A lot of this lesson seemed to be just repeat material from earlier in the course with a twist, until the later lessons. There was not a lot of writing code, though, mainly just reading the explanations in the lessons (a lot of text to read in these lessons), going through the code, and find things to change. Not necessarily a bad thing, per se, but I was expecting the final lesson of the course to be much more jam packed with coding.

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the [Learn Python 3: Classes](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-classes) Codecademy project.

**Thoughts**
* I seem to be in a limbo state where I understand the concept, I can create class structures and objects based off of them without issue, but I still have that feeling that I am missing something. Based off of this project, I really have no reason to feel that way. Perhaps it is because I am still being fed the information like the class names, parameters, etc., so I have not actually had to create everything from scratch-scratch yet, even though I was able to write all of the code in this project without assistance.

* See "Thoughts"

**Thoughts**
* Decided to spend time researching more about OOP to deepen my understanding before continuing on.

* No coding performed today.

### Day 1: March 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Walked through Object Oriented Programming tutorials on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp), and went through their exercises. 
* Reset and went through the [Learn Python 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-classes) Codecademy lesson again.

**Thoughts**
* The reason for finding additional tutorials and resetting the Codecademy lesson is because it simply was not clicking last night. I was able to complete the lesson by following the examples in the instructions, but there were parts that my tired brain was just not comprehending. Now that I am going through everything with a fresh brain, everything is clicking.

### Day 0: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Forked the 100 Days of Code repo, and edited it accordingly.
* Created a new repo for my CMMC Assessment Tool conversion.
* Learned how to format Markdown, and created a proper README.md for the repo.
* Finished the Codecademy course "Learn Python: Inheritance and Polymorphism".
