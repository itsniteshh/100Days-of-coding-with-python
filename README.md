# 100Days-of-coding-with-python
## I've joined this #100 days of coding challenge but unlike last time, I don't want to stop in between so this will first be a #21 days challenge and then 


Topics and things covered in this #100 days will be:

- :zap: firstly will complete the git and github tutorial on Day 0.
- 🌱 Then will move to FreecodeCamp's Python for Everybody Course and will complete the python segment first
- :heart:	 Next will be moving to Python Crash Course book tutorials and all exercises 
- 📫 And finally, will start with the #100 days of python coding course which I bought from Udemy
 
  - :Will be updating all the courses here everyda even if it's for 1 hr or less coz, consistency is key.
